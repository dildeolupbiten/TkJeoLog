<h2><a name="Version9.52"></a>Version 9.52 (2020-03-19)</h2>
<p> Highlights in this release include:
<ul>
<li>
<p>The 9.52 release replaces the 9.51 release after a problem was reported with 9.51
which warranted the quick turnaround. Thus, like 9.51, 9.52 is primarily a maintenance
release, consolidating the changes we introduced in 9.50.
</li>
<li>
<p>We have continued our work on code hygiene for this release, with a focus on the
static analysis tool Coverity (from <a href="https://www.synopsys.com">Synopsys, Inc</a>)
and we have now adopted a policy of maintaining zero Coverity issues in the
Ghostscript/GhostPDL source base.
</li>
<li>
<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> In consultation with a representative of
(<a href="http://www.openprinting.org">OpenPrinting</a>) it is
our intention to deprecate and, in the not distant future, remove the
OpenPrinting Vector/Raster Printer Drivers (that is, the <code>opvp</code>
and <code>oprp</code> devices).
<p> If you rely on either of these devices, <b><i>please</i></b> get in touch with
us, so we can discuss your use case, and revise our plans accordingly.
</li>
<li>
<p>IMPORTANT: We have forked LittleCMS2 into LittleCMS2mt (the "mt" indicating "multi-thread").
LCMS2 is not thread-safe, and cannot be made thread-safe without breaking the ABI. Our fork
will be thread-safe and include performance enhancements (these changes have all be been
offered and rejected upstream). We will maintain compatibility between Ghostscript and LCMS2
for a time, but not in perpetuity. If there is sufficient interest, our fork will be
available as its own package separately from Ghostscript (and MuPDF).
</li>
<li>
<p>The usual round of bug fixes, compatibility changes, and incremental improvements.
</li>
</ul>
<p>For a list of open issues, or to report problems,
please visit <a href="http://bugs.ghostscript.com/">bugs.ghostscript.com</a>.
<h3><a name="9.52_Incompatible_changes"></a>Incompatible changes</h3>
<h4>Included below are incompatible changes from recent releases (the
specific release in question listed in parentheses). We include these,
for now, as we are aware that not everyone upgrades with every release.</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(9.52) As of 9.52, the Windows binaries released by the Ghostscript development
team are built with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019. As a result Microsoft Windows XP and
earlier are no longer supported by these binaries. This does not imply we are or will
start relying upon features only available in VS2019, so the <code>nmake</code> Makefiles
will continue to allow older Visual Studio versions (back to VS2005) to build Ghostscript.
</li>
<li>
<p>(9.52) <code>-dALLOWPSTRANSPARENCY</code>: The transparency compositor (and related
features), whilst we are improving it, remains sensitive to being driven correctly, and
incorrect use can have unexpected/undefined results. Hence, as part of improving security,
we limited access to these operators, originally using the <code>-dSAFER</code> feature.
As we made "SAFER" the default mode, that became unacceptable, hence the new option
<a href="Use.htm#ALLOWPSTRANSPARENCY">-dALLOWPSTRANSPARENCY</a> which enables
access to the operators.
</li>
<li>
<p>(9.50) There are a couple of subtle incompatibilities between the old and new SAFER
implementations. Firstly, as mentioned in the 9.50 release notes, SAFER now leaves
standard Postscript functionality unchanged (except for the file access limitations).
Secondly, the interaction with <code>save</code>&sol;<code>restore</code> operations,
see <a href="Use.htm#Safer">SAFER</a>.
<p><strong>Important Note for Windows Users</strong>:
<br>
The file/path pattern matching is case sensitive, even on Windows. This is a
change in behaviour compared to the old code which, on Windows, was case
<i>in</i>sensitive. This is in recognition of changes in Windows behaviour,
in that it now supports (although does not enforce) case sensitivity.
</li>
<li>
<p>(9.27) The process of &quot;tidying&quot; the Postscript name space should have removed
only non-standard and undocumented operators. Nevertheless, it is possible that
any integrations or utilities that rely on those non-standard and undocumented
operators may stop working, or may change behaviour.
<p>If you encounter such a case, please contact us (either the #ghostscript IRC channel,
or the gs-devel mailing list would be best), and we'll work with you to either find an
alternative solution or return the previous functionality if there is genuinely no other
option.
<p>One case we know this has occurred is GSView 5 (and earlier). GSView 5 support for PDF
files relied upon internal use only features that are no longer available. GSView 5 will
still work as previously for Postscript files. For PDF files, users are encouraged to look
at <a href="https://www.mupdf.com">MuPDF</a>.
</li>
